### 2. INSTALLING THE PIPELINE
- Make sure you have zenity installed in your system. Currently the GUI version only supports the use of zenity as a GUI platform.
- Download the files **GUI_Alpha_6_installer.sh** and **GUI_Alpha_6_installer.txt** into a working directory.
- Run the script **GUI_Alpha_6_installer.sh** by opening your terminal in the working directory and entering 

  ```
  bash GUI_Alpha_6_installer.sh
  ```
- Make sure you have an active internet connection and admin privileges of your current system.
- Please enter your system superuser password whenever required.
- Please assign a working directory for the pipeline, when required.
- Please make sure your proxy settings allow you connection to the aptitude (APT) repository.
- All the software and packages required for running the pipeline will be installed in your system.
- Please refer to the RUNNING THE PIPELINE section for help regarding running the pipeline.

### 3. RUNNING THE PIPELINE
- Make sure you have zenity installed in your system. Currently the GUI version only supports the use of zenity as a GUI platform.
- Download the files **GUI_Alpha_6.sh** into your working directory, as specified earlier.
- Run the script 'GUI_Alpha_6.sh' by opening your terminal in the working directory and entering 

  ```
  bash GUI_Alpha_6.sh
  ```
- The GUI will guide you along with selection of input files and binaries.
- Please do not repeat any steps for selection of input files. 
- The progress bar will give you a graphical overview of the pipeline progress.
- A complete run of the pipeline with 3 human paired-ended case-control samples will take around 8 hours on a 20 threads machine. Please be patient.
- The shell, alternatively will give you the details of the tasks running at the time.
- After the completion of the run, a folder with the run name assigned by you, will be created in your $HOME directory. All the generated files can be found here.
- Please refer to the RESULTS section for help regarding interpretation of the pipeline results.

### 4. INPUT FILES
- Raw reads (.FASTQ.gz)
- Reference genome (.Fa)
- Reference annotation (.GTF)
- Reference transcriptome (.Fa)
- Known LncRNAs (.Fa)
- Binaries directory (bin)

### 5. RESULTS
- The results will be generated in the $run directory, under $HOME.
- The following directories will be created:
